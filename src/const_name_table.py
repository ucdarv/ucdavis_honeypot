# We use a name table for generating fake names and their associated email
# addresses. One key element while generating fake names is `diversity` within
# the names. Therefore, we use the following resources to generate common names
# from around the world.
#
# The format is:
# __Country_Name__: __Common_First_Name__
#     __Common_Last_Name__
#
# American: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/decades/century.html
#     https://www.al.com/news/2019/10/50-most-common-last-names-in-america.html
# Chinese: https://improvemandarin.com/most-popular-chinese-names/
#     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_surname
# Indian: https://forebears.io/india/forenames
#     https://forebears.io/india/surnames
